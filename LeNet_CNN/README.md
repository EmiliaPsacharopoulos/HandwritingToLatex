# LeNet Concolutional Neural Network

We followed instructions from the following [website](https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/07/19/pytorch-training-your-first-convolutional-neural-network-cnn/) to implement this CNN. This is the basic file dependency description of that implementation (as written on the website linked above):
1. lenet.py: Our PyTorch implementation of the famous LeNet architecture
2. train.py: Trains LeNet on the KMNIST dataset using PyTorch, then serializes the trained model to disk (i.e., model.pth). Note: for our implementation, we are using the EMNIST dataset. 
3. predict.py: Loads our trained model from disk, makes predictions on testing images, and displays the results on our screen
