# HandwritingToLatex
We are a student project team enrolled in EECS 351: Digital Signal Processing and Analysis at the University of Michigan.
This GitHub repository hosts our code using various Python sklearn library classifiers, a neural network library, and Matlab models to perform character identification. Click the hyperlinks below to access a Jupiter Notebook file for each classification method.
