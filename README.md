# Handwriting to LaTeX
## Project Motivation
Have you ever been sick and missed class? Did you try to watch the recording and then it dawned on you that your Professor does not use electronic slides and you'll need to decipher the board by zooming in real close, and then the pain settles in. Our project is aimed to help remedy this problem.  All the student needs to do is input screenshots of the whiteboard from their lecture recording, and our program translates the written characters into a well-formatted Latex document. It will be as though you were in class all along.  

## Project Description

We are a student project team enrolled in EECS 351: Digital Signal Processing and Analysis at the University of Michigan.
Our overarching goal for the project is to develop an algorithm that allows a user to input a screenshot of a lecture board, and output a nicely formatted LaTeX document of those notes in return. There are four main components to the architecture of our implementation:
1. Image processing and filtering of the lecture recording screenshot.
2. Isolating each individual character.
3. Classifying each individual character.
4. Outputting that classified character to a Latex document.

## Project Implementation

This GitHub repository hosts all code for our entire project implementation. Click the hyperlinks below to access more information regarding our process implementing each subsection, and the project code in its entirety. 

### Image Processing and Filtering
Our main objective of this process is distinguishing the handwriting from the blemishes and scratches on the given surface. We applied various filtering and image processing techniques in MATLAB to manipulate the signal and only assign value to detected handwriting information. Our signal processing is lossy because the handwritten characters and numbers containing encircled regions is completely filled. As a result, we implemented a mask in the Character Isolation subsection to retain that information.

### Character Isolation
This section is highly dependent on the handwriting style of any individual image. We needed to take into account that the spacing between characters will vary heavily, and that nobody can write on a perfectly straight line. This means that our system must be shift invariant to correct the character separation issue, and rotation invariant to correct the imperfect lines of writing. The character isolation process was definitely the most algorithmically-intensive process to design in our project due to the difficulty of making this subsystem shift and rotation invariant. 



### Character Classification
This section takes in an image of an isolated character from the Character Isolation process, and classifies that image as a character. We decided to compare the predicted character outputs of five common character classification techniques using Python's sklearn classification library. We trained each classifier on the EMNIST dataset's 60,000 training images and then tested each with EMNIST's 10,000 testing images, and then ranked the overall efficiency of each classifier according to its accuracy while also considering speed, and memory. Our Jupiter Notebook files for these methods are almost identical, apart from setting nb_classifier to the given method.

3. [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/HandwritingToLatex/blob/main/SVM.ipynb)
4. [Decision Tree](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/HandwritingToLatex/blob/main/DecisionTree.ipynb)

We implemented a convolutional neural network following the LeNet structure. Our process in Python can be broken down into creating the network architecture, training the network, and making predictions with the network.

5. [Neural Network](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/HandwritingToLatex/blob/main/LeNet_CNN)

The five classification methods listed above were for our own testing purposes in choosing the best method for this specific application. Overall, the Support Vector Machine led in accuracy, but we decided to use the LeNet Neural Network classification technique for its high accuracy, low memory usage, speed efficiency, and straightforward interface with MATLAB.

Our character classification subsystem implementation in MATLAB can be split into two primary processes: image processing and executing the model. Each process is its own script.

2. [Model Training](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/HandwritingToLatex/blob/main/train_test.m)



### Latex Document Formatting
We created a script in MATLAB that converts the outputted classified characters from the Character Classification subsection to a LaTeX file. Our function currently takes in the user-defined lecture title and date metadata, then combines that information with the lecture content in the body of the document.

###  Project Code in its Entirety
The entire system follows the flowchart inserted above. It can be run by downloading the folder "matlabHandwriting" and running "edgesd.m". Some things to note before running the demo:
* You must set up the python environment in MATLAB using pyenv at the command line 
* You must load the python module nnpredict.py
    * (detailed instructions in [predict_letter](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/HandwritingToLatex/blob/main/matlabHandwriting/predict_letter.m) )
* You must change the directory to your personal location of the folder
